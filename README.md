This is a demo plugin for the original [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/software/imagej)
that uses ImageJ2's [ImageJ-TensorFlow](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tensorflow)
library from a plain ImageJ plugin, rather than from an ImageJ2-enabled application.

To try it on Linux 64-bit, install Maven, then run:

    source run.sh
